I embarked a challenge to strictly budget my expenses on food a few weeks ago. After watching Josh of Brothers Green doing a $21 a week challenge in New York City, I decided to do the same. However, in my case, I was limiting myself to $11 a week, cutting off $10 from the original challenge. I had saved up frozen and canned ingredients; hence I really only needed to buy the ingredients I lack, such as garlic, vegetable oil, or fruits. In other words, I didn't cook strictly from the groceries I picked up like Josh; to make it clear from the beginning.

Now, on to the items on my grocery list, I bought more variety with less amount. As an example, instead of buying a bag of mandarins, I bought one count of different types of fruits. Here is the list of items I purchased on day one:

* 1 pink lady apple
* 1 pear
* 1 lemon
* 1 lime
* 1 knob of garlic
* a bunch of scallions for almost $1
* 3 bananas
* pure vegetable oil
* almond milk
* a dozen of eggs (cost me around $1.60)

**Total:** $11.06

To give a little context, I currently live in Central Illinois, where the sales tax is 0.25% lower than Chicago. I also shopped at a local grocery store (called Haddad's Market in West Peoria in case you're curious) instead of Aldi. Unlike shopping at Aldi, shopping at a local grocery store enabled me to avoid paying for bulk, which allowed me to get more variety by paying for a single item of each variety for most produce items. Some things like almond milk and eggs were purchased from Aldi as it was cheaper. I was about to buy a knob of ginger, but I ditched that idea and used powdered ginger instead. In my kitchen, I already had the Kirkland Stir-Fry Vegetable Blend from Costco, sweet potatoes, a piece of a leftover chicken breast (approximately 1.5 lbs), yellow onions, and of course, a bag of rice (a must have in my pantry!) 

The first things I did on day one was to cook the shredded chicken. I had to avoid recipes that require an oven or a microwave altogether, as I had no access to these at my apartment at the time. What I did have was a dutch oven, a non-stick pan, and a wok, which work wonders to my mission. In case you are curious about how can one live without owning a microwave, this [article](http://retrohousewifegoesgreen.com/how-to-live-without-a-microwave/) might give you some inspiration. I'm not saying, however, that I have not used a microwave for the seven months of not owning one. My workplace has some microwave ovens. So, for lunches, I portion and freeze my meals and reheat them at work.

Listed below are the five meals I made from spending $11 on groceries. I actually made the last two meals the next week, since the first three meals were sufficient for the entire week's meal. I also happened to be invited to events where I got to eat for free, which helped me save three meals.

### Meal #1
**Japanese Chicken Curry With Sweet Potatoes**

As a disclaimer, I didn't come up with the recipes for these meals. For this chicken curry, I followed a recipe from [this website](https://www.justonecookbook.com/simple-chicken-curry/). For the stock, I have made a homemade chicken stock from some leftover chicken bones. Making chicken stock at home, although time-consuming, not only helps with saving extra bucks, but also gives you better tasting stock! I also made the curry roux from scratch, by following [this tutorial](https://www.justonecookbook.com/how-to-make-curry-roux/).

### Meal #2
**Breaded Chicken with Honey Mayo Sauce**
In the beginning, I tried to follow the recipe for [chicken teriyaki](https://sortedfood.com/recipe/teriyakichicken), but I was rather in the mood for a mayo dip instead of salty teriyaki sauce. So, I made my own mayo using an egg yolk, a pinch of dijon mustard, and vegetable oil.

I prefer my mayo to be thick and fluffy. My mayo actually came out very light and more liquid in the first few whisks. I tried mixing the vegetable oil with a bit of olive oil, and *voil√†*!

### Meal #3
**Sup Merah (Indo-Dutch Red Soup)**
*Sup Merah* (*soup myrrh ah*) is a typical homecooked dish back where I'm from. They say the dish is adapted from the Dutch stew called *Bruine Bonensoep*, which makes some sense considering Dutch's level of control over my hometown prior to World War II. I happened to have Kielbasa, which I sliced into the size of matchsticks. It doesn't take very long to cook this soup, as long as the ingredients are prepared beforehand. I personally have added this dish as one of my go-to weekday meals. I have tried to compile a brief recipe of my version of *sup merah*, which I will post soon. 


### Meal #4
**Chorizo Corn Pasta**
I forgot to take picture of this meal. Perhaps the dish was too simple, that it didn't feel like I was actually cooking. The ingredients comprise of one chorizo sausage (I used one of the size you find in Costco), tomato paste, sweet corn kernels, pasta, and chopped Kielbasa (or any other type of smoked sausage). I chopped the Kielbasa piece I happened to have into tiny cubes, stir-fried it with oil and the chorizo, before throwing the cooked pasta and corn kernels into the same pan.

### Meal #5
**Nasi Goreng Jawa**
This dish is basically a version of fried rice specifically from Java island of Indonesia (Jawa ~ Java). Like almost every other Asian fried rice, this dish contains some sort of green vegetable, scrambled eggs, onion, garlic, and soy sauce. The difference with this version, however, is the added palm sugar, which usually is already included in the kind of soy sauce used in that island. If you go to any grocery store in Java island, you'd more likely find more sweetened soy sauce than the regular soy sauce you find in Asian stores in the US. However, since I don't have that type of soy sauce, I added brown sugar to my soy sauce, which works quite close to when using palm sugar. I also added *sambal oelek* of a brand from my hometown, called [Sambal Bu Rudy](http://indonesiaeats.com/sambal-bawang-sambal-setan-shallot-garlic-devil-sambal/) for additional Javanese taste.


Completing a week of being in such a tight budget has really helped me in building the habit of eating in and wasting less ingredient. While I have already been trying as much as I can to bring lunch to work instead of dining in the cafeteria, I can't deny how often I'm being disillusioned by the convenience that is promised by drive-thru services and fast-casual restaurants like Chipotle and the like. I can see how preparing meals at home can be quicker, when counting in travel time, traffic, and queueing in line. Although, it can indeed take longer when the cook takes time in food prep. I think, ultimately, my takeaway from this challenge is to scout a few go-to dishes and learn how to make them up to the point that making them becomes a mindless task.
