As I was starting my unemployed-no income-job hunting-still figuring out what’s next life, somebody from church recommended me “Every Good Endeavor” by Tim Keller, the lead pastor of the Redeemer Presbyterian Church in New York City. I’m not being dramatic; but I don’t think I would have the positive outlook I have now with my career, if I had not read this book. Through “Every Good Endeavor”, Tim Keller has explained how can Christians see beyond the dualistic view of faith and work in a way that is not only easy to understand, but also deeply relatable.

In order to understand connection between faith and work, one must first understand how God designed work. Hence, Pastor Keller divided the book into three parts: God’s plan for work, our problems with work, and the Gospel and work. In the first part, Pastor Keller explained in detail what is God’s design for work, taking from Genesis 1 in the bible. After explaining God’s design for work, he transitioned into the root issues with work after the first humans, Adam and Eve, fell into sin, and how sin is the root cause. Finally, in the third part, Pastor Keller gives concrete examples, some from experiences of Christian professionals he knows, how to translate the new understanding of work in the context of Christian faith into action.
One of my favorite quotes from this book is:

> When you realize what he has done to rescue you, your pride and envy begin to disappear because you don’t need to get your self-worth from being richer, cooler, more powerful, or more comfortable … Instead of working out of false passion of [a life driven by mere cost-benefit analysis of ‘what’s in it for me.’], which is born of selfishness, you are working out of true passion, which is born of selflessness.

One thing that’s been the most rough about graduating from college with no job lined up is how the experience has made me questioned my self-worth over and over. Questions like “Do I have what it takes to be an engineer?” often comes up. In some days, I lost the mental battle and went to bed feeling beaten up and worthless. It was after I read this book, that I was reminded that my identity is not in my job title, but in God’s grace. It is such shift of identity that has put off a lot of pressure from trying to prove myself, and allowed me to improve my knowledge and skills just because I’m passionate about it; and that’s all I’m asking for in my career: that I’ll be able to do what I love doing.

Besides, this moment of temporary unemployment is a life lesson, not of failure, but of gratitude. I have learned to appreciate little things in life that I used to take for granted, such as food on the table and a comfortable bed to sleep on. What matters now, is how I, as Natasha, can help my surroundings, with the skills I have, to make the world a little bit better place to live. This is ultimately my calling anyway, regardless of being employed or not.
